## Sears Computron c. 1987

        The only speak-and-spell type thing I could find with an auto read-out-loud mode and math...
  </summary>
  <hr>
  <p>
    I was looking for basically a speak-and-spell that could go on autopilot mode, reading and displaying words out loud, and that could also do basic arithmetic. This seemed potentially a little more geared towards vintage or hip and I thought it might be breakable, but it was perfect. My kid could play around with it independently and the membrane keyboard and overall ergonomics made that pretty painless. The biggest stumbling point was getting it into the right mode on startup since it needs you to "choose an activity" every time it's turned on, but he learned pretty quickly what his favorites were and could get going without help before he could even read.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The C batteries seemed like they might be an issue, but I bought a set of adapters for standard AA (or maybe AAA) rechargeable batteries, and it has somehow literally never needed to be recharged, which is insane since we got it over 2 years ago. Another thing to note is that this device was originally marketed to have cartridge vocabulary expansion packs that sometimes came with books. I thought we might get into those, but they are hard to find and we never needed to go that far.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This device got him ready for a ThinkPad very quickly, but he still loves booting it up occasionally. The math activities, in particular, will continue to be challenging for a while if and when he picks it up again. It seems like you can still find them online for around $35, which is crazy since I couldn’t find a modern equivalent, but there might be something out there.

[you can usually find them on ebay for $40~$60](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=sears+computron&_sacat=0&_odkw=computron+kids&_osacat=0)

## ThinkPad T470 
(or Mac Mini or Raspberry Pi 4)

        Just a cheap tough first computer for them play freely with...
  </summary>
  <hr>
  <p>I started off with a Raspberry Pi but could have just started with a ThinkPad, old Apple laptop, Mac Mini, etc. I noticed really early on that typing on a keyboard was much more natural and engaging than I was expecting. Just letting him type in a text file seemed to naturally help him learn letters and numbers. Initially, I set it up to go into a program immediately on boot up, like a basic text editor or the terminal/command line. I also initially didn't give him a mouse and disabled the trackpad since that seemed to trip him up. If he wanted to do anything, I just talked him through doing it with the keyboard. Most of that was googlable if I didn't know how to do it.</p>
  
  <p>The Windows Key or Command + Space usually brings up a text search for any application, and you can use Tab and Enter to navigate around. For a while, watching a very curated list of music and short science videos was his main reward that motivated him to learn how to use the keyboard on his own. It was still difficult enough that he needed some verbal instruction, which naturally limited out-of-control screen time. One big advantage to using an old Apple or Mac Mini is that the Terminal command line allows you to type "say" followed by anything, and it will speak it out loud. I had him do this on an old Mac laptop, and I think it was hugely helpful.</p>
  
  <p>You can set up the "say" feature on Linux or Windows, but it's more of a pain (still 100% googlable). Letting them mess around freely in the command line allows the potential to mess up the computer, so I was always ready to do a factory reset, but he never actually did any damage. I also tried making simple command line apps that would run the speak-out-loud stuff more automatically, and he used that a lot while learning to read. The T470 was recommended by software engineer friends because they're tough, and refurbished ones can last forever without major issues (I've had no issues so far), though I'm not sure about other ThinkPads.</p>

</details>

[ThinkPad T470's refurbished are usually $120-$200](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=refurbished+lenovo+thinkpad+T470&crid=VL4B1DP52LPH&sprefix=refurbished+lenovo+thinkpad+t47%2Caps%2C196&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)

[Any Mac Mini works too and is easier to set up, old ones can be $100-$150](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mac+mini+refurb&crid=12W3NU4G4KR05&sprefix=mac+mini+ref%2Caps%2C321&ref=nb_sb_ss_pltr-data-refreshed_3_12)

[Raspberri Pis also work for around $60](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=raspberry+pi+4&crid=3AV0EJELQQK4R&sprefix=raspberry+pi+%2Caps%2C198&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)

## Sketchy Animal Workbooks
"Teacher Created Resources"

        Right length, right level of challange, can be worked on without a lot of help, good price...
  </summary>
  <hr>
  <p>
      These we're a random find. Was having trouble finding workbooks he could engage with. Was making my own worksheets for a while but couldn't make them diverse enough or fast enough, in any case ut wasn't working. Just bought a bunch of random ones at some point to see what he would connect with. He got really into the patterns book in this series so I bought a bunch more. They seem like the right length to encourage finishing them and the right level of challange. Planning to continue using these to support / augment school curriculum when it feels appropriate going forward. He also particularly seemed to connect with the math puzzles, reading comprehension and subtraction one. A lot are available on amazon, I had to resort to ebay for a couple. 
  </p>

[On amazon most are $2-8](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=teacher+created+resources+workbooks&crid=26JG80UXJPLOH&sprefix=teacher+created+resources+work%2Caps%2C210&ref=nb_sb_ss_pltr-data-refreshed_1_30)

## Talking Calculator

        Seemed like it would be a normal thing to want a kid to have...
  </summary>

  <p>
      This one's pretty stright forward. Wanted to get something for him to play with while he was learning to read. Could only find old ones but worked out fine. Settled on this one in particular for some reason but there are a lot of options. Had to make sure it used standard available AA or AAA batteries. He didn't play with it a lot but it was around. Easy enough to find some version of this on ebay.
  </p>

[I think I got ours for maybe $10-$16](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=talking%20calculator)

## Fruit Abacus

    This one's pretty self-explanatory...
  </summary>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Had pretty good engagement doing addition and subtraction on this as well as multiplication and division. Seemed like we could have used it to really master all of those but pulled back to not disrupt the natural math progression at school. Planning to continue to use this all the way through multiplication / division though. He seemed to really connect with phrasing multiplication as "_____ groups of ______" and division as "______ split into groups of _______". Also made up some hand games for addition and subtraction, number bumps and number munches where we would hold up numbers on each hand and "bump" them together onto one hand or pairing up fingers one at a time and having one hand "munch" the fingers off the other for subtraction.

[Seems like you can still find these for around $16](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fruit+abacus)

## Duo Lingo

    Only major point was doing it on his ThinkPad rather than the phone...
  </summary>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Resorted to this after not having a lot of luck with non-screen resources, flashcards and workbooks etc. He loved it for a while but lost momentum after getting into more intermediate sections with complete sentences. Letting him pick the languages seemed positive and we were shocked that he could pass most of the early lessons without any supervision / assistance. Their UI was surprisingly easy for him to use. Also tried their music and math but for some reason those are only on mobile and he really didn't connect with either at all unfortunately. I was paying for Duo Lingo for a while but that doesn't really seem necessary. I've let Duo Lingo go for the most part with him but when we get back to languages it will be my primary resource.
