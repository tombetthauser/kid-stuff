        The only speak-and-spell type thing I could find with an auto read-out-loud mode and math...

  <p>
      I was looking for basically a speak and spell that could go on autopilot mode just reading / displaying words out loud and that could also do basic arithmatic. This seemed potentially a little more geared towards vintage / hip and thought it might be breakable etc but it was perfect. My kid could play around with it independently and the membrane keyboard / overall ergonomics made that pretty painless. Biggest stumbling point was getting it into the right mode on startup since it needs you to "choose an activity" every time it's turned on but he learned pretty quickly what his favorites were and could get going without help before he could read etc. Also the C batteries seemed like they might be an issue but I bought a set of adapters for standard AA (or maybe AAA) rechargable batteries and it has somehow literally never needed them to be recharged, which is insane since we literally got it 2+ years ago. Other thing to note is that this thing was originally marketed to have cartridge vocab expansion packs that sometimes came with books. I thought we might get into those and they are hard to find but we never needed to go that far. This thing got him ready for a ThinkPad very quickly but he still loves booting it up occaisionally and the math especially will continue to be challanging for a while if / when he picks it up. Seems like you can find them online still for around $35 occaisionally, it's crazy that I couldn't just find a modern equivalent but there might be something out there.

## ThinkPad T470 
(or Mac Mini or Raspberry Pi 4)

        Just a cheap tough first computer for them play freely with...
  </summary>

      I started off with a raspberry pi but could have just started with a ThinkPad or an old apple laptop, mac mini etc. I noticed really early on that typing on a keyboard was much more natural / engaging than I was expecting. Just letting him type in a text file seemed like it was naturally helping him learn letters and numbers. Initially I set it up so it would go into a program immediately on boot up, like a basic text editor or the terminal / command line. I also initially didn't give him a mouse and disabled the track pad since that just seemed to trip him up. If he wanted to do anything I just talked him through doing it with the keyboard. I knew how to do most of that but it's always googlable. The Windows Key or Command Space will usually bring up a text search for any application and you can use tab and enter to navigate around. For a while watching a very curated list of music and short science videos was his main reward that we could tempt him with and he was very motivated to learn how to do that on his own with the keyboard. It was still always difficult enough though that he would need some verbal instruction so that naturally prevented a lot of out of control screen time. One big advantage to using an old apple or mac mini is that the Terminal command line program allows you to type "say" followed by whatever they want and it will speak it out loud. I had him do this on an old mac laptop initially and I think it was hugely helpful. You can set that up on Linux or Windows but it's much more of a pain. Still 100% googlable. Letting them mess around freely in the command line allows them to potentially really mess up the computer so I was always ready to have to do a factory reset on whatever he was playing on but he never actually messed anything up. I did also try to make some simple command line apps that would run the speak-out-loud stuff more automatically and he did end up using that a lot as he was learning to read. They're a little more techy to set up but I'll link them here at some point. The T470 was recommended to me by software engineer friends I think mainly because they are tough and the refurbished ones can last forever without major issues (I've had no issues whatsoever), not sure about all the other ThinkPads.

[ThinkPad T470's refurbished are usually $120-$200](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=refurbished+lenovo+thinkpad+T470&crid=VL4B1DP52LPH&sprefix=refurbished+lenovo+thinkpad+t47%2Caps%2C196&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)

[Any Mac Mini works too and is easier to set up, old ones can be $100-$150](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mac+mini+refurb&crid=12W3NU4G4KR05&sprefix=mac+mini+ref%2Caps%2C321&ref=nb_sb_ss_pltr-data-refreshed_3_12)

[Raspberri Pis also work for around $60](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=raspberry+pi+4&crid=3AV0EJELQQK4R&sprefix=raspberry+pi+%2Caps%2C198&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)

        Right length, right level of challange, can be worked on without a lot of help, good price...

      These we're a random find. Was having trouble finding workbooks he could engage with. Was making my own worksheets for a while but couldn't make them diverse enough or fast enough, in any case ut wasn't working. Just bought a bunch of random ones at some point to see what he would connect with. He got really into the patterns book in this series so I bought a bunch more. They seem like the right length to encourage finishing them and the right level of challange. Planning to continue using these to support / augment school curriculum when it feels appropriate going forward. He also particularly seemed to connect with the math puzzles, reading comprehension and subtraction one. A lot are available on amazon, I had to resort to ebay for a couple.

      This one's pretty stright forward. Wanted to get something for him to play with while he was learning to read. Could only find old ones but worked out fine. Settled on this one in particular for some reason but there are a lot of options. Had to make sure it used standard available AA or AAA batteries. He didn't play with it a lot but it was around. Easy enough to find some version of this on ebay.
